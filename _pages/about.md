I am a Phd candidate in Reinforcement Learning for Flight Control, under the supervison of Dr. [Erik-Jan van Kampen](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/e.vankampen/), at [Control and Simulation Section](https://www.tudelft.nl/lr/organisatie/afdelingen/control-and-operations/control-and-simulation), [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/), Delft, the Netherlands. My doctoral research aims to achieve safe and sample-efficient learning for aerial vehicles, including [perching fixed-wing aircraft](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ZeGJULQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=ZeGJULQAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C), [spacecraft](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10178221), addressing practical challenges such as reducing the model dependence of controllers, [improving control action smoothness](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ZeGJULQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=ZeGJULQAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC), improving tracking convergence and [exploiting model symmetry](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ZeGJULQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=ZeGJULQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC), as well as [algorithm issues](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/JAEEEZ.ASENG-5097) such as convergence, stability and model uncertainty. This work leverages knowledge from machine learning, optimal control, flight dynamics, and data-driven control.
